Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules: http://sudoku.com.au/TheRules.aspx

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.


A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

---------------------------------------------
Just trying to explain how to think about % and /. These two operators can be helpful for matrix traversal problems.

For a block traversal, it goes the following way.

0,0, 0,1, 0,2; < --- 3 Horizontal Steps followed by 1 Vertical step to next level.

1,0, 1,1, 1,2; < --- 3 Horizontal Steps followed by 1 Vertical step to next level.

2,0, 2,1, 2,2; < --- 3 Horizontal Steps.

And so on...
But, the j iterates from 0 to 9.

But we need to stop after 3 horizontal steps, and go down 1 step vertical.

Use % for horizontal traversal. Because % increments by 1 for each j : 0%3 = 0 , 1%3 = 1, 2%3 = 2, and resets back. So this covers horizontal traversal for each block by 3 steps.

Use / for vertical traversal. Because / increments by 1 after every 3 j: 0/3 = 0; 1/3 = 0; 2/3 =0; 3/3 = 1.

So far, for a given block, you can traverse the whole block using just j.

But because j is just 0 to 9, it will stay only first block. But to increment block, use i. To move horizontally to next block, use % again : ColIndex = 3 * i%3 (Multiply by 3 so that the next block is after 3 columns. Ie 0,0 is start of first block, second block is 0,3 (not 0,1);

Similarly, to move to next block vertically, use / and multiply by 3 as explained above.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
